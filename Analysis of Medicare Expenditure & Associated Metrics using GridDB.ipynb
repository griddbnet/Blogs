    "Initiated in 1965, <b> Medicare </b> is one of the most revolutionary plans initiated by the the United States' National Health Insurance Program. Medicare was created to provide equal and adequate access to healthcare for senior citizens of the United States. Though the insurance is primarily offered to citizens aged 65 and older, it is also offered for younger people with disability, including those with chronic end-stage life conditions. Medicare coverage includes four parts - Part A, Part B, Part C and Part D. Read more about each of these coverages <a href = \"https://www.medicare.gov/basics/get-started-with-medicare/medicare-basics/parts-of-medicare\"> here. </a> To read more on claim types, refer to this <a href = \"https://resdac.org/cms-data/variables/nch-claim-type-code\"> resource </a>."

    "There are several open source datasets related to Medicare available for research. Such datasets have been gathered and analyzed as part of this analysis to get a general idea of the demographics and associated metrics like spending, annual spending per user, and so on. Some of these datasets have data as of 2022 whereas some do not. However, though some data is not up-to-date, it still makes sense to use the information to get insights. Details of each dataset has been explained in the section below. We load these datasets into GridDB in order to use GridDB's fast query engine and then visualize the results using the Altair and Matplotlib libraries in Python."

Doing a 'Limit 10' alone will not suffice, as it will just return the top brands that have had top sales in one of the years and for one of the coverage types available. Hence, a subquery needs to be written to get insight into the top 10 brands. GridDB supports standard SQL subqueries.

GridDB has some reserved keywords that should be avoided while naming containers and columns as much as possible. If you accidentally used one of these reserved keywords, <b> encapsulate it in square brackets '[]' </b>. As an example, the container PartD_Drug_Spending has the column 'values' which is a reserved keyword.
